<p>
    This is the <code>&lt;imgur-uploader-file-input&gt;</code> component.
    If you just want to add a file input (that has imgur uploading
    capabilities) to an existing page or form, then this is the way to go.
</p>
<h5>Options</h5>
<ul>
    <li><b>inputClass</b> (@): set a class on the input element</li>
    <li>
        <b>uploaderConfig</b> (Object):
        A scope Object with an <code>onReady</code> method that takes
        an <code>uploaderApi</code> argument. The <code>uploaderApi</code>
        can then be used to interact with the file that is selected.
        The <code>uploaderApi</code> has the following methods:
        <ul>
            <li><b>getFile</b>: return file info about the selected file</li>
            <li><b>submit</b>: upload the selected file to imgur</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
